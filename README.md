An exhibit about the Future of Democracy.

## Compilation

To install the required dependencies run `npm install` in **both** the root directory and the
`server` directory.

You can use `npm run build` or `npm run watch` in the root directory to build the client apps. The
server does not require compilation.

The `.env` file in the root directory contains settings that are applied at compilation time.

## Running

Start the server by running `npm run start` in the `server` directory.

The clients, in the root directory, are:

- `index.html`: Default client.

## Configuration

The .env file has configuration keys that affect the environment.

## Server APIs

The server has both an HTTP and a WebSocket API. Their specifications are:

- http: `specs/openapi.yaml`
- ws: `specs/asyncapi.yaml`

You can use [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) and the
[AsyncAPI Playground](https://playground.asyncapi.io/) to format the respective specifications in
a friendly format.
